# Axon Ivy RPA

An RPA (Robotic Process Automation) is a software robot that automates repetitive, rule-based tasks typically performed by humans. 
It mimics human actions, such as data entry, form filling, and file processing, to streamline workflows and increase 
efficiency in various business processes.
